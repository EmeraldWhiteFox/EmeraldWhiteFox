- 👋 Hi, I’m @EmeraldWhiteFox
- 👀 I’m interested in creating video games for pleasure or education. I love the genres fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript so I can code the games I want to create.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games if others would like to help create them. It is difficult to join big companies so having the freedom to create my own content would be the best.
- 📫 How to reach me: robinsonr11@nku.edu
